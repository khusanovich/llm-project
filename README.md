Goal of Your Project

To build a simple full-stack LLM-powered app that lets users:

Ask a question via a web interface →
The question is sent to a local AI model (like phi) running with Ollama →
The AI generates a response →
The response is shown back to the user in the browser.

What We've Built So Far
Part	Description
Frontend	A minimal HTML page with an input box and "Send" button
Backend	A FastAPI server that handles POST requests and forwards prompts to the model
LLM Model	The phi model running locally via Ollama, generating answers
Integration	Frontend talks to backend → backend talks to model → model generates reply

Current Features
Local model runs without internet.
Real-time user interaction (ask & get answer).
Full-stack working end-to-end (HTML + JS + Python + LLM).

Why Is This Useful?
We're building the foundation for:
Chatbots 💬
Educational tools 📚
AI assistants 🤖
Internal company tools with local models 🏢

1. Set Up the Frontend
created an HTML page that takes input from the user.
used JavaScript (with fetch) to send that input to a backend.
update the UI with the model’s response.
✅ That's basic frontend development.

2. Built the Backend Server (API)
used FastAPI to handle HTTP requests (like POST /generate).
parsed JSON, extracted the prompt, and connected it to the model.
returned the result to the frontend.
✅ That’s solid backend development and API handling.

3. Connected Frontend + Backend + Model
wired up a full flow: browser → server → model → back to browser.
debugged CORS, handled ports, figured out errors like 405, 404, etc.
managed multiple terminals, running both a web server and a model server.
✅ That’s full-stack integration, which is real developer work.

🔹 What does your project do?
project is a simple full-stack app that lets a user:
Enter a question or prompt in a web page (frontend),
The prompt is sent to a Python backend,
The backend uses a local LLM (like Phi) to generate a response,
The response is shown back on the web page.
Basically:
“User types a question → LLM processes it → Answer is returned to the browser”
# 🧠 LLM Local Chat with Mistral + Ollama
This project is a minimal example of using a **local Large Language Model (LLM)** with Python and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). It uses the open-source **Mistral** model to generate text completely offline — no API keys, no cloud, just local power 💪
---
## 🚀 Features
- 🔒 100% offline LLM inference with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- 🧪 Python script to send prompts to the local model
- ✅ Virtual environment with clean setup
- 📁 Git-tracked project structure
---
## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running
- Mistral model pulled locally:
  
  ```bash
  ollama pull mistral



✅ What I’ve Done So Far (Recap)
🔧 1. Set Up 
 Local Project Environment
Created a folder: llm-project/

Created a virtual environment (venv) and activated it

Installed required packages like openai and ollama

Created your first Python script (test_openai.py, mistral_chat.py) to use OpenAI and/or Ollama

⚙️ 2. Tested OpenAI and Ollama APIs
Got an error from OpenAI due to API quota limits

Switched to using Ollama locally with models like llama2 (offline, free)

Successfully interacted with the model (mistral_chat.py)

🧠 3. Used Git and GitHub for Version Control
Initialized Git repo

Created and edited .gitignore to exclude venv/ and .env (important)

Pushed the project to GitHub using SSH ✅

📄 4. Created requirements.txt
Added dependencies so others can install them easily using pip install -r requirements.txt
